# Medical Insurance Data Analysis Using SQL
Welcome to the Medical Insurance Data Analysis project repository! This project utilizes SQL to analyze medical insurance data, providing insights into various aspects such as claim amounts, patient demographics, and health conditions. The project aims to offer valuable information for better decision-making in healthcare management.

## Introduction
The Medical Insurance Data Analysis project is designed to help healthcare organizations and insurance companies make informed decisions by providing a detailed analysis of medical insurance data. By examining key metrics such as claim amounts, BMI values, and the distribution of smokers across regions, this project aims to offer valuable insights for strategic planning and policy-making. SQL is used to perform complex queries and derive actionable insights from the dataset.

## Situation
The objective was to develop a comprehensive data analysis report using SQL to understand medical insurance trends and derive insights that could assist in strategic planning, healthcare management, and policy-making.

## Problem Statement
The Medical Insurance Data Analysis project aimed to address several critical business questions:

##### 1. What are the details of all patients in the dataset?
##### 2. What is the average claim amount for patients in each region?
##### 3. What are the maximum and minimum BMI values in the dataset?
##### 4. Which patients have a BMI between 40 and 50?
##### 5. How many smokers are there in each region?
##### 6. What is the average claim amount for patients who are both diabetic and smokers?
##### 7. Who are the patients with a BMI greater than the average BMI of smokers?
##### 8. What is the average claim amount for patients in different age groups?
##### 9. What is the total claim amount for each patient and the average claim amount across all patients?
##### 10. Who are the top 3 patients with the highest claim amounts?
##### 11. Which patients have a claim amount greater than the average for their region?
##### 12. What is the rank of each patient based on their claim amount?
##### 13. What is the rank of each patient based on their claim amount within their region?


## Task
Developed a comprehensive SQL-based analysis report to visualize medical insurance data and provide actionable insights.

## Key Features
##### 1. Analysis of total patient details.
##### 2. Average claim amount by region.
##### 3. Maximum and minimum BMI values.
##### 4. Patients with BMI between 40 and 50.
##### 5. Number of smokers in each region.
##### 6. Average claim amount for diabetic smokers.
##### 7. Patients with BMI greater than the average of smokers.
##### 8. Average claim amount by age group.
##### 9. Total and average claim amounts for patients.
##### 10. Top 3 patients with highest claims.
##### 11. Patients with claims above regional average.
##### 12. Patient rank based on claim amount.
##### 13. Regional rank of patients based on claim amount.
